<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Large bunch of parsley, finely chopped</li>
    <li>Finely chopped oregano</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</li>
    <li>2 rosemary sprigs, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 red chilli, chopped</li>
    <li>35ml red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1kg piece of Bavette steak (or skirt steak) </li>
    <li>4 Portobello mushrooms</li>
    <li>12 whole cherry tomatoes on the vine</li>
    <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Watercress or Arugula, to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix together the parsley, oregano, garlic, rosemary, chilli, red wine vinegar and a third of the oil. Season with a little salt and pepper then leave to infuse for approximately 2 hours.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, heat a large griddle pan over a high heat.</li>
    <li>Brush the steak on both sides with the remaining oil, then, when the griddle is smoking hot, carefully put it on to the pan and fry for 4 minutes on each side. Remove the steak, wrap in tin foil and leave to rest</li>
    <li>Put the sliced mushrooms on to the griddle in a single layer and cook for 2 minutes on each side. Take the mushrooms off the griddle, then add the tomatoes and cook for approximately 2 minutes as well.</li>
    <li>Carve the steak against the grain into long, thin slices and arrange the slices on a serving platter. Drizzle with a generous amount of chimichurri sauce and serve with the mushrooms, tomatoes and watercress.</li>
